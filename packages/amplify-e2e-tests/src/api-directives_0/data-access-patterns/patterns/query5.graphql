## 5. Get orders for a given customer within a given date range:
#There is a one-to-many relation that lets all the orders of a customer be queried.

#This relationship is created by having the `@key` name `byCustomerByDate` on the Order model that is queried by the connection on the orders field of the Customer model.

#A sort key with the date is used. What this means is that the GraphQL resolver can use predicates like `Between` to efficiently search the date range rather than scanning all records in the database and then filtering them out.

#The query one would need to get the orders to a customer within a date range would be:

query getCustomerWithOrdersByDate($customerID: ID!) {
  getCustomer(id: $customerID) {
    ordersByDate(date: { between: ["2018-01-22", "2020-10-11"] }) {
      items {
        id
        amount
        productID
      }
    }
  }
}
