## 8. Find all employees working in a given warehouse:
#This needs a one to many relationship from warehouses to employees. As can be seen from the @connection in the `Warehouse` model, this connection uses the `byWarehouse` key on the `Employee` model. The relevant query would look like this:

query getWarehouse($warehouseID: ID!) {
  getWarehouse(id: $warehouseID) {
    id
    employees {
      items {
        id
        name
        startDate
        phoneNumber
        jobTitle
      }
    }
  }
}
