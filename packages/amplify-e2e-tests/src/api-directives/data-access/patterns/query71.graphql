##7. alternative: We can also query and have the results returned by start date by using the `employeesNewHireByStartDate` query:

query employeesNewHireByDate {
  employeesNewHireByStartDate(newHire: "true") {
    items {
      id
      name
      phoneNumber
      startDate
      jobTitle
    }
  }
}
