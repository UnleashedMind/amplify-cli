## 10. Get current inventories for a product at all warehouses:

#The query needed to get the inventories of a product in all warehouses would be:

query getProductInventoryInfo($productID: ID!) {
  getProduct(id: $productID) {
    id
    inventories {
      items {
        warehouseID
        inventoryAmount
      }
    }
  }
}
