## 2. Query employee details by employee name:
#The `@key` `byName` on the `Employee` type makes this access-pattern feasible because under the covers an index is created and a query is used to match against the name field. We can use this query:

query employeeByName($name: String!) {
  employeeByName(name: $name) {
    items {
      id
      name
      phoneNumber
      startDate
      jobTitle
    }
  }
}
