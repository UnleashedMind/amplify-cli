## 6. Show all open orders within a given date range across all customers:
#The `@key` `byCustomerByStatusByDate` enables you to run a query that would work for this access pattern.

#In this example, a composite sort key (combination of two or more keys) with the `status` and `date` is used. What this means is that the unique identifier of a record in the database is created by concatenating these two fields (status and date) together, and then the GraphQL resolver can use predicates like `Between` or `Contains` to efficiently search the unique identifier for matches rather than scanning all records in the database and then filtering them out.

query getCustomerWithOrdersByStatusDate($customerID: ID!) {
  getCustomer(id: $customerID) {
    ordersByStatusDate (statusDate: {
      between: [
        { status: "pending" date:  "2018-01-22" },
        { status: "pending", date: "2020-10-11"}
      ]}) {
        items {
            id
            amount
            date
        }
    }
  }
}
