## 12. Get orders by account representative and date:

#As can be seen in the AccountRepresentative model this connection uses the `byRepresentativebyDate` field on the `Order` model to create the connection needed. The query needed would look like this:

query getOrdersForAccountRepresentative($representativeId: ID!) {
  getAccountRepresentative(id: $representativeId) {
    id
    orders(date: {
      between: [
         "2010-01-22", "2020-10-11"
      ]
    }) {
        items {
          id
          status
          amount
          date
        }
    }
  }
}
