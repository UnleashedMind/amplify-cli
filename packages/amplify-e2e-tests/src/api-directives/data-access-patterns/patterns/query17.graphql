## 17. Get sales representatives ranked by order total and sales period:
#It's uncertain exactly what this means. My take is that the sales period is either a date range or maybe even a month or week. Therefore we can set the sales period as a string and query using the combination of `salesPeriod` and `orderTotal`. We can also set the `sortDirection` in order to get the return values from largest to smallest:

query repsByPeriodAndTotal {
  repsByPeriodAndTotal(
    sortDirection: DESC,
    salesPeriod: "January 2019",
    orderTotal: {
      ge: 1000
    }) {
    items {
      id
      orderTotal
    }
  }
}
