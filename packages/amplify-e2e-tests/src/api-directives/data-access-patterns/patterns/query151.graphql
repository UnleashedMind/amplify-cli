We can also get all inventory from an individual warehouse by using the `itemsByWarehouseID` query created by the `byWarehouseID` key:

```graphql
query byWarehouseId($warehouseID: ID!) {
  itemsByWarehouseID(warehouseID: $warehouseID) {
    items {
      inventoryAmount
      productID
    }
  }
}
```

## 16. Get total product inventory:
How this would be done depends on the use case. If one just wants a list of all inventories in all warehouses, one could just run a list inventories on the Inventory model:

```graphql
query listInventorys {
  listInventorys {
    items {
      productID
      warehouseID
      inventoryAmount
    }
  }
}
```

## 17. Get sales representatives ranked by order total and sales period:
It's uncertain exactly what this means. My take is that the sales period is either a date range or maybe even a month or week. Therefore we can set the sales period as a string and query using the combination of `salesPeriod` and `orderTotal`. We can also set the `sortDirection` in order to get the return values from largest to smallest:

```graphql
query repsByPeriodAndTotal {
  repsByPeriodAndTotal(
    sortDirection: DESC,
    salesPeriod: "January 2019",
    orderTotal: {
      ge: 1000
    }) {
    items {
      id
      orderTotal
    }
  }
}
```
