## 9. Get all items on order for a given product:
#This access-pattern would use a one-to-many relation from products to orders. With this query we can get all orders of a given product:

query getProductOrders($productID: ID!) {
  getProduct(id: $productID) {
    id
    orders {
      items {
        id
        status
        amount
        date
      }
    }
  }
}
